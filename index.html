                    <li>Experience:  I can understand and perform the necessary tasks in a data-related project. Specifically,
                        I have experience in data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and exploratory analysis. For each
                        specific problem, it is important to have the appropriate preprocessing techniques based on the
                        objectives, such as determining which features are relevant and which are not. Additionally, it is
                        crucial to have a good understanding of the algorithms being used and how they operate in order to
                        effectively address the problem at hand. This knowledge enables informed decision-making and the
                        appropriate use of data.</li>
